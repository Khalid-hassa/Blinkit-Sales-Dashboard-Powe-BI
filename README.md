Key Features:

2. Outlet Size and Type Performance: Insights into sales, ratings, and item visibility across different outlet sizes and types (Grocery Store, Supermarket Types 1-3).

3. Establishment Year Trend: Tracked sales trends over time, highlighting peak sales in specific years.

4. FAT Content and Tier Analysis: Analyzed performance across low-fat and regular items, segmented by outlet tiers (Tier 1-3).
